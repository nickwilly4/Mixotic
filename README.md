Mixotic is an open-source DJ board emulator designed to create a seamless DJing experience. The ultimate goal of Mixotic is to run on a Raspberry Pi with a screen, taking inputs from various analog components connected through a Teensy microcontroller. The Teensy communicates the values of the analog components to the Raspberry Pi, which performs all the digital signal processing. This combination of hardware and software aims to emulate the functionalities of a professional DJ board.
